# Contributing to Glint

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please read these guidelines to make collaboration smooth.

Getting started
- Check open issues and pull requests before starting work.
- For larger features, open an issue first to discuss.

Code style
- GDScript files should follow Godot's recommended style: snake_case for functions and variables, scenes with clear node names.
- Keep scripts small and focused. Add comments for non-obvious logic.

Branching & commits
- Create feature branches from `main`:
  - `feature/<short-description>`
  - `fix/<issue-number>-short-description`
- Write descriptive commit messages. Reference issue numbers when relevant.

Pull requests
- Open a PR against `main`.
- Include a clear description of changes, screenshots or gifs if UI/visual changes, and testing steps.
- Link related issues in the PR description.

Testing
- Play the scenes locally and ensure there are no runtime errors.
- If you change physics or timing-critical code, test player movement and collisions thoroughly.

Assets & licensing
- Only add assets you have the right to include. List third-party assets in ASSETS.md with license links and attribution.

Code of conduct
- By contributing you agree to follow the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
